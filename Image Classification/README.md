## Cats and Dogs Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project demonstrates building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The script loads a dataset of cat and dog images, preprocesses the data by resizing it to a fixed size, converts it to grayscale, and saves the preprocessed data to two pickle files. The CNN is built using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries, and trained on the preprocessed image data. The model is then used to predict the category of a single input image. Finally, the predicted category is printed to the console. The code also includes the use of TensorBoard, a visualization tool provided by TensorFlow, for monitoring the training process.
